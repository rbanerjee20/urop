# Smartphone Security App (UROP 2019)

This is the repository for the work I did during July and August 2019, as part of the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) at Imperial College London. I created an Android app using Java that monitors smartphone security behaviours. I was supervised by Dr Soteris Demetriou of the [Applications, Platforms and Systems Security Lab](https://apss.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at Imperial College London. 

The repository is structured as follows:

* `Report` contains the technical report I wrote at the end of my UROP, covering what I worked on in depth
* `Slides` contains the presentation slides I created on a weekly basis to show my supervisor what progress I had made
* `Software` contains the code for my app

**NB:** The majority of the commit history for this repository is on the Department of Computing's internal GitLab server.
